# Sem-Precursor cathode active material defect-classification
# SEM NMC precursor cathode active material(pCAM) Image Analysis

This repository showcases a typical workflow for analyzing Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images, including defect detection, particle segmentation, and statistical visualization.This code is specialized for precursor NMC particle feature analysis. 

## 🔬 Overview

SEM images provide detailed surface morphology information critical for materials research and defect analysis. In this project, we demonstrate:

- Pre-processing SEM images
- Segmentation and feature extraction
- Defect classification and visualization(Agglomeration particle, fine particle,Normal particle)
- Example code using Python (OpenCV, scikit-image)

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** The images used here are either simulated or anonymized for demonstration purposes. Please ensure you comply with your organization’s data sharing policies before using real SEM data.
